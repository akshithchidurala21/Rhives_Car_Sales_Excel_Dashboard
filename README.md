# Car Sales Data Analysis – Rhives Technologies (Excel Project)

This project is part of my **Week 1 Data Analyst Internship at Rhives Technologies**, where I analyzed a dataset of **50,000 car sales records** using Microsoft Excel.
The goal was to uncover insights related to **manufacturer trends, fuel type distribution, mileage patterns, and price–mileage relationships**, and present them using a clean and interactive Excel dashboard.

### **Project Highlights**

* Performed data cleaning and applied Excel functions such as
  **COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF, MODE, MIN/MAX, INDEX-MATCH**
* Created **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts** to summarize key attributes
* Designed a **professional dashboard** featuring KPI cards and visual insights
* Explored major trends including:

  * VW & BMW dominance in dataset
  * Petrol as the most common fuel type
  * Strong **negative correlation** between price & mileage
  * VW as the highest mileage brand
  * Identification of best-value car (lowest price per mile)

###  **Files Included**

* **Car_Sales_Analysis.xlsx** – full analysis, formulas, and dashboard
* **Dashboard Screenshot** – PNG image of the Excel dashboard
* **Presentation File (PPT)** – summary slides of the project insights

###  **Key Learnings**

* Pivot Table mastery and chart-based storytelling
* Understanding real-world trends using data-driven techniques
* Experience in creating corporate-style dashboards and presentations
